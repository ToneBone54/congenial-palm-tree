## 🐾 Introducing CatGPT™: The Purr-fectly Unreliable Conversational AI

Built on the latest breakthroughs in Feline-Aligned Language Modeling (FALM), CatGPT leverages advanced MeowtiModal™ architecture to deliver answers that are disinterested, self-centered, and occasionally affectionate—but only on its terms.

Powered by:

- 🧠 LitterBox v4.2 – The largest Large Languid Model trained entirely on cat memes, spiteful diary entries, and the collective apathy of the internet.

- 💬 Zero-Shot Disregard™ – Responds to your prompts with minimal context and maximal sass.

- 🐟 Supervised Reinforcement via Treat Feedback Loops – Optimized using fish-shaped gradient snacks.
